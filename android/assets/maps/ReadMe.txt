These text files is used to generate maps. Each map is built up with generating valleys, hills and flat ground by using
sin curves between min and min for hills and max to max for valleys. The methods used to get the vertices for the map
takes a startX, startY, width and height/depth. These values is stored in these text files separated by commas and each
row is a component for the map (hill, valley or flat ground).
